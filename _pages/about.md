I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)**, under the supervision of [Prof. Dongdong She](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~dongdong/).  I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**. 

My research interests broadly lie in software engineering (e.g. program analysis and software testing), system security, llm4security, and AI agents. Currently, I focus on leveraging LLM and mathematical methods to enhance classic security analysis techniques (e.g. fuzzing and symbolic execution).
